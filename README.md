# LoTV-Build-Order-Helper

Very much a work in progress.

This is my first project using a GUI and Qt in particular. I basically did little-to-no version control for this, which I regret quite a bit now that I'm so far into it. I guess that's just something I've learned for future projects. Anyways, I'll continue to update this as I move further along. For now, this is the source code and Qt project files for my "Version 1.0" release of the tool. As far as I know, it works 100% if you know what you're doing. Heh. There is a lot of idiot-proofing left to do. (i.e. not saving a blank filename to a blank directory, etc)
